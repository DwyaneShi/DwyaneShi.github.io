* Research Scientist at ByteDance Infrastructure System Lab

My research interests include High-Performance Interconnects and Protocols (e.g., RDMA), Erasure Coding, In-Network Computing, and Distributed Systems.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, advised by [Prof. Xiaoyi Lu](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/luxi). I received my bachelor's degree from Tianjin University, China.
